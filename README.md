# TownHallBrawl

TownHallBrawl is a probability-betting CLI game that 'simulates' a dysfunctional Town Hall Meeting.

[Here's my demo video]()

## Installation

Run 'bundle install' to install required gems.

```bash
bundle install
```

Run 'rake db:migrate' in the root directory to create the database locally.

```bash
rake db:migrate
```

Have fun playing the game!
